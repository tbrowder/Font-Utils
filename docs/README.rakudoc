=head1 NAME

B<Font::Utils> - Provides routines and programs to interrogate font directories
and individual font files. 

B<NOTE>: The intent is for this module to work on Linux, MacOS, and
Windows.  Please file an issue if you need it on your OS.  The package
requires use of the 'V<PDF::Font::Loader:ver<0.8.8>>' which has recently
been ported to those two systems.

=head2 font-utils

Modes:

=begin item 
list $directory | @dirs, :$out = $*OUT

Uses routine C<list> to provide a list
of font families and their fonts in the input directories.
=end item

=begin item 
show $file | @files | @dirs, :$out = $*OUT

Uses routine C<show> to provide a list of each
input font's attributes.
=end item

=begin item 
sample @fonts | @dirs, :$text, :$media = 'Letter', :$orientation = 'Portrait',
                       :$linespacing = 16, :$nglyphs, :$out = $*OUT

Uses routine C<sample> to create a PDF document showing each
input font at a default size of 12 points on Letter paper
in Portrait orientation.

If no text is supplied, and no specific number of glyphs is
entered, the sample will show as many glyphs as can be shown
on a single line of the alphanumeric
glyphs in that font.
