Try using experimental trait "is cached" with monitor classes
+ use the monitor ignored class with it

Check for using zef "linear" on Windows so can determine which module is failing

Use a new monitor class for font chars

DONE Fix all tests in xt-hold

Add font license text
  - see Checkwriter for some good stuff

DONE Add option to FaceFreeType to not check width or height of a glyph
  - add separate checks for width and height inside the sample?

Move graphics stuff to PDF::GraphicsUtils

Tidy the sample output format

Fix build script to force creating
  the "font-files.list" during
  GitHub workflows testing

DONE Create a routine to make a glyph showing box with each
glyph's hex code, glyph, font bbox, origin, bearings,
horizontal advance, and baseline. Each glyph should
be inside a box outlined by the font bbox.

Get "Adobe" name for urw fonts (use in post-script name?)
Work on tracking vertical position of text boxes
  + need a string breaking routine for font samples

Define (and maybe decompose) the TextBox for reuse. Be sure and
describe the use of:
  + determing the actual bbox
  + applying a constraint after determining the "natural"
      bbox dimension (squeeze, constrain width or height
      or both)

Do as above for printing a line.

DONE Get a list of different font file types for testing in xt

Add info for MacOS and Windows
  see unpublished FontFactory for OS installation code

Add more font collections

Add scripts to install fonts by root user
  use Auth::Utils linter or do by hand for downloadable script

Ensure *.yml files load required font files
  see FontFactory for some examples
