Add font license text

Fix build script to force creating
  the "font-files.list" during
  GitHub workflows testing

Create a routine to make a glyph showing box with each
glyph's hex code, glyph, font bbox, origin, bearings,
horizontal advance, and baseline. Each glyph should
be inside a box outlined by the font bbox.

Get "Adobe" name for urw fonts (use in post-script name?)
Work on tracking vertical position of text boxes
  + need a string breaking routine for font samples

Define (and maybe decompose) the TextBox for reuse. Be sure and
describe the use of:
  + determing the actual bbox
  + applying a constraint after determining the "natural"
      bbox dimension (squeeze, constrain width or height
      or both)

Do as above for printing a line.
