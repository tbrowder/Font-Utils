    For a new installation, creates file '$f'
    and populates it with the OpenType, TrueType, and PFB font files
    found on the user's file system.

    For an existing installation, checks the file for errors and
    aborts if any error is found.

    The font list consists of one entry per line. Comments and blank
    lines are ignored. Data lines consist of three space-separated
    fields:

        1. Unique key
        2. Basename of the font file
        3. Path of that font file

    For an original installation, the files are listed in type order.
    Within a set of the same file types, the order is alphanumeric by
    basename. Users may edit the file for their own needs as long as
    each field is valid.
