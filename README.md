NAME
====

**Font::Utils** - Provides routines and programs to interrogate font directories and individual font files. 

**NOTE**: The intent is for this module to work on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Please file an issue if you need it on your OS. The package requires use of the 'PDF::Font::Loader:ver<0.8.9+>' which has recently been ported to those two systems.

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Font::Utils;
my $dir = "/usr/share/fonts/opentype/freefont
font-utils list $dir;
font-utils show $font-file;
font-utils sample $font-file;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**Font::Utils** contains the following installed program, classes, and routines:

Program
-------

### font-utils

    font-utils <mode> [...options...]

### Modes

#### list

`list $directory, :$out = $*OUT`

Uses routine `list` to provide a list of font families and their fonts in the input directory. Any other entry will show the user's list.

#### show 

`show $font-file, :$out = $*OUT`

Uses routine `show` to provide a list of the input font's attributes.

#### sample

    sample $font-file, :$media = 'Letter', 
                            :$out = "sample.pdf"

Uses routine `sample` to create a PDF document showing each input font at a default size of 12 points on Letter paper in Portrait orientation.

If no text is supplied, and no specific number of glyphs is entered, the sample will show as many glyphs as can be shown on a single line of the alphanumeric glyphs in that font.

Classes
-------

### class FaceFreeFont

Contains all the attributes obtained in the `$face` object created by module 'Font::FreeFont' from a font file loaded with the 'load-font routine of module 'PDF::Font::Loader'. In addition, it adds most of the font interrogation methods from its 'Font::FreeType' $face object.

The class is instantiated by two required attributes:

  * $font - the font object created by 'PDF::Font::Loader' from a font file.

  * $font-size - the desired font size in points (72 points = 1 inch).

There are two other important attributes that affect the object creation and its method that selects glyphs to use from the font file:

  * - has $.width-check = True;

  * - has $.height-check = True;

By default, any glyph that has zero width or height is ignored. Usually those are control chatacters you wouldn't want to display, but some are special typesetting characters that a using program may need. Thus the user can turn those checks on by declaring one or both True at object creation.

Routines
--------

In Raku font handling we are constantly dealing with various font and typesetting parameter conversions such as length and angle units, and decimal and hexidecimal glyph code points. Those required for module internals and testing are incLuded. Some of those routines are duplicated in other modules, but having them close is useful.

### hex2string

    sub hex2string(
        $code-point-list, 
        --> Str) is export {...}

Given a list of hexadecimal code points, convert them to a string. You may indicate a range of code points by separating the end points with a hyphen. For example:

    my @symbols = "21-2f 3a-40 5b-60 7b-7e";
    my $s = hex2string @symbols;
    say $s;
    !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~

### dec2string

    sub dec2string(
        $code-point-list, 
        --> Str) is export {...}

Given a list of decimal code points, convert them to a string. You may indicate a range of code points by separating the end points with a hyphen. For example:

    my @symbols = "33-47 58-64 91-96 123-126";
    my $s = dec2string @symbols;
    say $s;
    !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~

### write-line

    sub write-line(
        $page,
        :$font!,  # DocFont object
        :$text!,
        :$x!, :$y!,
        :$align = "left", # left, right, center
        :$valign = "baseline", # baseline, top, bottom
        :$debug,
    ) is export {

### rescale

    sub rescale(
        $font,
        :$debug,
        --> Numeric
        ) is export {...}

Given a font object with its size setting (.size) and a string of text you want to be an actual height X, returns the calculated setting size to achieve that top bearing.

### hex2dec

    sub hex2dec(
        Str $hex
        --> Numeric
        ) is export {...}

Converts an input hex string to a decimal number.

### text-box

    sub text-box(
        Str $text,
        :$font!,      #= fixed at creation
        :$font-size!, #= fixed at creation
        # variable args
        :$ulx, :$ull, #= upper-left corner coordinates
        :$width, :$height,


        --> PDF::Contents::Text::Box
        ) is export {...}

Given a chunk of text, a font object and font size, returns a text-box object that can be interrogated and manipulated and reused to print text boxes on a PDF page. Some parameters are fixed as marked in the signature above, but the rest can be changed upon reuse.

Fixed parameters:

Variable parameters:

Data
----

Included with the module is a hash (`%uni`) with the hexadecimal code points for the following named sets of Unicode glyphs:

<table class="pod-table">
<thead><tr>
<th>Set name</th> <th>Hash key</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr> <td>Basic Latin (ASCII)</td> <td>(two sets)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>+ Symbols</td> <td>L-sym</td> </tr> <tr> <td>+ Characters</td> <td>L-chr</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Latin-1 Supplement</td> <td>L1-Sup</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Latin Extended A</td> <td>L-Ext-A</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Latin Extended B</td> <td>L-Ext-B</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Latin Extended C</td> <td>L-Ext-C</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Latin Extended D</td> <td>L-Ext-D</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Latin Extended E</td> <td>L-Ext-E</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Latin Additional</td> <td>L-Additional</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Latin Ligatures</td> <td>L-Ligatures</td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Note that the Free Fonts do **NOT** cover all those glyphs, but the Noto fonts do if you need the largest coverage. The Free Fonts are more attractive to my eyes, but that is an artistic decision. You can most always find a free or paid font if you look for it (see [https://monotype.com](https://monotype.com) as a good example where I found a MICR bank font file for personal desktop use for a very reasonable price: about the same as a couple of six-packs of my favorite IPA.
